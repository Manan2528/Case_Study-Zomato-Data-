Zomato Data Analysis (EDA) - Case Study

This project is a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Zomato food delivery data, aiming to uncover actionable insights about restaurant performance, top-rated dishes, and city-wise food trends. 
Using Python and pandas, we analyze customer ratings, dish popularity, and pricing across Indian cities.

The primary objective is to identify:
- The highest-rated dishes in each city.
- The best restaurant for every individual dish based on customer votes.
- Key patterns across cuisines, pricing, and customer preferences.

The analysis helps us answer practical questions such as:  
*Which restaurant is best for Chicken Biryani in Hyderabad?* or *What is the most popular dish in Bangalore?*
